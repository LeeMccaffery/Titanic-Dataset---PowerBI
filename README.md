# 🚢 Titanic Passenger Insights: A Power BI Exploration  

## ✨ Project Overview  
This project delves into the **Titanic dataset** to uncover fascinating insights about the passengers aboard the ill-fated ship. Using **Power BI**, I explored the dataset, cleaned the data, and created visually engaging reports that showcase key information about passenger demographics, survival rates, and embarkation points. The final report combines multiple visuals into an interactive dashboard to tell the story behind the data.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques  
### Power BI  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Renamed and reformatted columns for better clarity.  
  - Replaced coded values with descriptive labels (e.g., survival status, passenger class, embarkation points).  
  - Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns like "Cabin."  

- **Data Transformation**:  
  - Created a new **Family Size** column for deeper insights into travel groups.  
  - Extracted surnames and titles by splitting passenger names.  

- **Visualizations**:  
  - Pie chart for gender distribution.  
  - Bar chart showing class distribution.  
  - Survival rate bar chart.  
  - Treemap for embarkation point analysis (filtered for survivors).

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Demographics**: The majority of passengers were male, with a diverse mix across class tiers (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).  
- **Survival Analysis**: First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to other classes.  
- **Embarkation Trends**: Southampton was the most common embarkation point, contributing a large share of passengers.
